Re-Accumulation\n\nThe Pre-Halving retrace is followed by multi-month re-accumulation (red)\n\nThis period can last up to 150 days (i.e 5 months)\n\nMany investors get shaken-out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving\n\nHowever, in this cycle it would be the very first time that this Re-Accumulation Range could develop around the New All Time High area\n\nAs a result, this Re-Accumulation Range may simply take the shape of a regular sideways range and may not last very long before additional uptrend continuation\n\n4.
