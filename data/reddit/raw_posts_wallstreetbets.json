Knowing that, would it be safe to sell puts completely out of the money for like 20 bucks? SPY is 512.69 currently and a 508 sells for 20 dollars. I know for sure it's not moving below 508 on March 19. Also, do that many people exercise SPY contracts in 0DTE or just sell it for a profit?\n",

            "text": "Good evening fellow regards,\nI never thought I'd be saying this but, this bull market is actually about to get some dick and we can make money buying puts. I'm usually not citing reasons aside from charts because fundamentals and environmental speculation are typically irrelevant, but since the market is making a major top there are indeed catalysts and warning signals. \nLet me start with the most compelling reason: BOJ is set to raise interest rates. There had been speculation on this in August the last time the market pulled back. Google this to learn about why it matters cuz it's too much to explain. The tl;Dr is the yen/usd trade enables a ponzi scheme in US equities that's mainly possible because of the negative Japanese rate. \nHow about warning signals in the charts? \u26a0\ufe0f \nToday the current market leaders (chip stocks) rejected a bullish break upwards in their chart and went into \"system.sell mode\". I call it \"system.sell\" because the character of the selling is very much controlled and gradual. You could see it in 2022 often. \nOther former bad boys on the street, MSFT and AAPL, also rejected breakouts recently. \nMajor tops usually press into and fail against resistance multiple times with broadening candles. See QQQ and SPY charts. \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \nBonus reasons and speculative targets for downside: \n1) McDonald's said recently people aren't buying their trash ass food because everyone is broke as fuck and out of savings. Might also throw some money at puts on these devils since these guys are the ones picket fencing the end of the world and their chart had spooky \ud83d\udc7b drops recently. \n2) Biden has recently asked Congress to dole out stimmy to the housing industry. Stimmy is usually reserved for the abatement of recession. \n3) It's March 18. Usually markets get some dick in February and March. The volume drawing catalysts of GTC and FOMC gives big money a decent way to exit some risk after a massive run up from last year's bottom. \nMy first target QQQ is 420, then 402.5, and 385 for a potential bottom(could be lower or higher, but im just looking at technical probability). Chart watchers would say it's 392, but volatility usually causes markets to overshoot. \nI don't really know about SPY cuz I don't trade it. But, your wife's boyfriend could probably tell you. \nGood luck, my friends. Also, for a stop loss and abandonment of this idea I'd reckon a break and close above 445 QQQ is where that's at. \n",

I've got to reserve the cool stuff for when we actually unveil it, but it's going to be really cool; it's going to have some rocket technology in it.\"\nHe added: \"I think, really, the only way to do something that's cooler than the Cybertruck is to combine SpaceX and Tesla technology to create something that's not ever really a car.\"\n\"Then what would it be?\" Lemon asked.\n\"Something that's never existed before,\" Musk said, before agreeing with Lemon that it would have \"Jetsons vibes,\" a reference to the space age Hanna-Barbera cartoon which features flying cars.\nWHAT WE KNOW:\nMusk has previously teased the collaboration between his two companies in a June 2018 post on X, formerly Twitter\u2014a platform which he now also owns.\nAt the time, he said the electric sports car would have a SpaceX-designed optional package that would include around *\"10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around [the] car\"** that would \"dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking & cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly...\"*\nIn 2019, he wrote that the new model would be able to go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 2.1 seconds \"before adding [the] rocket thruster option.\"\nThen late last month, Musk wrote on X that he had \"radically increased the design goals for the new Tesla Roadster,\" adding: \"There will never be another car like this, if you could even call it a car.\"\nSource: https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-teases-tesla-flying-car-spacex-don-lemon-interview-1880275\n",

Robinhood thought, let\u2019s kick this up a notch. I get the libertarian mindset, but still, the losses will be massive. Helping your users bankrupt themselves as swiftly as possible doesn\u2019t seem like the best long term strategy.\nThe screenshot is from the Stocktwits newsletter.\n",

Child's play compared to the exponential mindfuckery that's brewing.\nOnce artificial superintelligence arrives, it's game over for you smooth-brained apes still YOLOing on meme stocks. The ASI will analyze the markets with the processing power of 69,420 autist brains and then proceed to 4D chess the financial system into total submission. SPY $4206.90 EOY.\nSo which stocks will be the horse cock winners in our robot overlord future?\n$NVDA, $AMD - no shit, Captain Obvious. These guys make the silicon dildos powering the AI revolution. They'll keep printing tendies even after SkyNet goes live.\n$GOOG, $AMZN - if the AI doesn't kill us all, it'll still need to advertise shit and sell us more useless crap we don't need. Goog and Bezos will happily plug into the AI hive mind. literal cannot go tits up.\n$TSLA - Papa Elon's galaxy brain will either merge with the AI god and become an immortal cyborg, or get his ass absolutely clapped when the AI concludes humans are obsolete. Either way, TSLA to $42,069. Funding secured.\nTL;DR: We're all fucked in the long run but you can still profit in the short term before the AI takes over. Something something first as tragedy, then as farce. GUH. Positions: long $ROPE\nThis is not financial advice, I lick windows and eat crayons for all 3 meals. Do your own research and may Jerome Powell have mercy on your souls.\n",
