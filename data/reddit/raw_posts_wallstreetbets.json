In an era where data is the new oil, PSTG is sitting on a gold mine with its innovative data solutions and flash storage tech. Their financials? Stronger than a garlic martini. With consistent revenue growth year-over-year and a clientele that includes some of the biggest names in tech, healthcare, and finance, PSTG is not just walking the walk; it's moonwalking.\n2. Technical Analysis: The Stars Align\nLet's break down the technicals, where the charts whisper secrets to those who dare listen:\n\nBullish Patterns Galore: PSTG has been painting the town red with bullish patterns. A recent breakout from a cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart suggests a potential upward trajectory. For the uninitiated, this is like seeing a double rainbow with a pot of gold at both ends.\nMoving Averages are Your Friend: The 50-day moving average recently crossed above the 200-day moving average, a golden cross, signaling a bull market on the horizon. It's like the market's way of giving us the nod.\nVolume Speaks Volumes: An uptick in trading volume accompanies the breakout, confirming the bulls are in town, and they're not here for the tapas. They're here for the whole feast.\n\n3. Industry Tailwinds Like a Category 5 Hurricane\nData is growing at an exponential rate, and with the advent of AI, IoT, and 5G, the demand for efficient, reliable storage solutions is skyrocketing. PSTG is at the forefront of this revolution, with products that outperform the competition on speed, scalability, and cost-efficiency. It's like bringing a gun to a knife fight.\n$PSTG (Pure Storage) stands at the vanguard of revolutionizing how the world stores and accesses data, through their cutting-edge \"disruptive storage\" solutions. In an era where data generation and consumption are skyrocketing, their innovative approach to flash storage technology is not just about storing bytes; it's about redefining speed, efficiency, and reliability in data access. By dramatically reducing energy consumption and physical space needs, while simultaneously offering unparalleled data processing speeds, they\u2019re creating \u201cstorage-as-code\u201d basically changing how we view data storage as a whole, re-writing how much Megabytes, and gigabytes can really hold. In a recent hardware change over, one of their customers was able to reduce their IT footprint to 5% of what it previously was, with better results.\nAlso they just partnered with NVDA\nTLDR - put your life savings into $PSTG\nPositions - 60c 4/19\n",

            "text": "Hi regards,\nI am pissed. TSLA just go down and down and down everyday. I bought the dip on stock, it keeps on dipping, bought the dip on calls, it keeps on dipping, bought the dip on the car itself, well at least the car price stopped dipping. But only after I got the car, then I realize how good the car is.\nThen I asked myself, why the stock keeps going down? checked on X, everybody said interest rate is too high, demand problem etc. I was thinking, everybody around me seems fine, Papa Powell said the US economy is robust, job market remain tight etc, overall, everything fine!\nBut still... we got a problem, that's fine... but more importantly how are we gonna solve this problem? ads put on youtube, X, now even on facebook,so where are the demands? where?\nhere is what I did. I am so broke, I pulled out my phone, registered uber. Went on the road and make some $$$ buy more tsla calls.\nwhy uber? because people who use uber are either:\n\nDoes not have a car (potential buyer).\nhave a car, can't drive themselves, but need transportation. (potential FSD buyer)\nUber is MULTI-NATIONAL, regards all over the world can participate in this. If we regards can pull this off, imagine suddenly tesla uber showing up everywhere in the world overnight. Tesla gain more awareness, lead to demand picking up. I'm pretty sure they will make another movie about it.\nUbering in Tesla/EVs has a HUGE advantage over ICE when doing short trip. If you calculate the math, its about 13-25% more earnings.\nif you are 100% tsla, you gonna need to drive uber to supplement some income anyway.\n\nI have done 200 trips so far. This is what I gathered from this small sample size.\n\nlots of people (25% at least) doesn't even know how to open the tesla door!!!! that means they didn't even get into one of the tesla yet. At least in my area, that's the situation.\nThey LOVE LOVE LOVE the white interior and the roof, said they have never experience a car so clean and elegant! I said yeah Tesla is great, but I didn't say I clean the mess after they left everytime.\nLots of people asking me about the range anxiety, their information is still lagged in 2019. they don't know how long is the battery range, they don't know how fast the battery charge at home and super charger, they just don't know.\nLots of people asking me about the how does driving tesla feels like? I replied with my broken English to them, listed all the pros, cons I know of. They are very very surprised on no oil change for tesla.\nLots of people still think tesla is a 60k+ car instead of 30k-40k car.\nSome customers specifically ordered uber green/ green comfort, I asked them why is that, they said the Tesla experience is too good.\nSome people's friend went tesla, they can never go back to ICE.\n\nThere are many more, but my smooth brain cant list all of them out.\n\u200b\nSo in the end my smooth brain concluded that, these mfs just don't know!!!! The product is awsome@@! but they just don't know!!!! They are NOT gonna buy if they don't know!!! That's why we got a demand problem!!! Thats why the stock is dipping and dipping and dipping@@!\n\u200b\nSo I propose Mission TSLA$420.69 to all of those regards AROUND THE WORLD have major TSLA position, and have a tesla car.\n\nuber, spread the words. Uber has destination mode, you can pick up some folks on your way to work/school, and on your way back home.\nif you know how to create website or any other way/ form of plateform, create one. and let All the people who want to participate this together register. get each driver a QR code to post on the back of the driver/ passenger seat. Beside the QR code reads something like...\"Scan here if you like to know more about my tesla experience\".\nuber rider then can scan QR code, sound will pop up from their phone, driver start sharing. Be objective, say the pros, but make sure you also don't left out the cons. Honesty and sincerity is the best way.\nalso Post your referral link QR behind the seat\nand then we can even let the rider take some sort of survey etc. to collect some data\nlet riders record a 10 sec vid of what they what to tell elon, if we manage to pull this off, mail it to elon\nwe can brainstorm more\n\n\u200b\nMore people know about it and experience it, more Teslas will be sold. Then We go tendie town.\nNot financial advise, you do you.\n\u200b\nAs always, position:\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y1e1cc8uarqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50414688f9a1274e9fcc8b80031feb33af813264\nProof I Uber & Riders love tesla ride:\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4k6n64xdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0cd31db18cfa8dd0aef67ef206a24facaf6d4b7\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jezjv7xdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d0c94bceeadca005097cbb966e838330d508b18\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qvqni7xdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86e97eb59890f94630a5ed89b937716071967b97\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rskiqaxdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2248bee3eb91d2ee59ce953889fb67e5aa71d1ba\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shubk6xdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d9c39de736b8565a266cb2213f98bd02ac8132c\n\u200b\nTL;DR\nif you have tesla car, go uber, tell people tesla good, people buy tesla car, we get tendies.\n",

Has anyone seen a reddit ad that really got your attention recently? Doesn't it seem like the gut reaction here is that ads aren't going to be their main leg in this three pronged model? And then data licensing - is it really that hard to make a headless non-api-based bot to scrape data on an as needed basis? And then how many posts do you regularly see getting gold? Is there any more to the user economy that i left out? If you sell something through traffic on reddit, does reddit get a cut? I just am genuinely wondering if this stock could be driven up by anything other than its derivatives in the short term.\n",
