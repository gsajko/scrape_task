And there are some other decent plays like Cintas (CTAS) which is a great company that I\u2019m bullish on but options are very expensive.\nSo this is my prediction. McCormick and Company (MKC) will go up for two reason only. We passed the holidays where people made turkeys and to make a good turkey you need seasoning and who makes seasoning. MKC. That means it has to go up. Secondly MKC own Franks Red Hot and I really love franks red hot so it will go up. \nThanks for listening to my dumbass talk about hot sauce.
