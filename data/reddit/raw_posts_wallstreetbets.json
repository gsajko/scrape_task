            "text": "Canada Goose (GOOS) grew revenue and stock price like crazy until 2018. Then they decided to try direct to consumer and get into less warm ultra-luxury products. Because it worked well for their competitor Moncler and the ideas were popular generally, and why not cash in on the brand's popularity year-round instead of just selling winter coats. Also, lower priced brands like Moose Knuckles and Arc'teryx were on the rise. So it was easier for GOOS to move upward to ultra luxury. But the company still sells it's ultra functional heavy down parkas, so the risky move upward is countered by a solid recurring business.\nBut customers and investors didn't like the initial results of those changes. Customers complained about product quality (less goose down fill seen as low quality) and price increases. The fashion aspect wasn't creating enough appeal to offset those changes for customers either. Investors saw operational costs and inventory soar as the fashion and direct to consumer experiments increased marketing, leasing, and construction costs. Also inventory went up partially because of failed fashion experiments, but mostly because of the warm winters and work from home. So slower sales growth, tighter margins, and higher inventory made investors lose interest.\nDirect to consumer doesn't work certain products (like mattresses - remember Casper?) but it does for Moncler and Apple. No one sees what brand mattress you sleep on, but they do see what coat or fashion you wear. So brands are stronger in fashion apparel, especially outdoor fashion apparel. Both Moncler and Apple retail locations showcase their products like jewelry showrooms. So that's the direct to consumer vision GOOS adopted for their retail stores. It takes a lot of upfront investment to build the stores, and a lot of operational expenses experimenting with marketing and products. Once the company gets it right and streamlines operations, the excess expenses are history.\nThat's exactly the inflection point Canada Goose is at now. Their sales were up 40% on Black Friday weekend and their stores saw record traffic (brand is strong). However, temperatures rose to the mid 40s and 50s in the Northern US/Canada by mid December due to El Nino. But the winds are a changin'! On Thursday, the National Weather Service predicted (https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.shtml) that the next winter is likely to be a cold one. The line to get in at my local Canada Goose store used to be 2 hours long during cold winters!\nMoreover, work from home is slowly reversing. Everyone I talk to from programmers to business roles and lawyers, reports having to go into work more often this year vs last year. It's clear that most companies don't like work from home. Going into work means everyone has to wear their coats more often. With the extra wear and tear, they need to buy new ones for the colder winter next year. Also lots of people haven't needed to buy a heavy winter coat since before COVID. GOOS will sell a fuck ton more coats next year. But we don't have to wait until then.\nTheir rain wear, sweaters, shirts, and accessories are selling better this year than last year already. I talked to one of their store employee today about a range of topics, and this was the most surprising part. Despite the push into non-winter wear since way back in 2018, they are now beating their sales targets on these items. Dude was super cool and genuinely enthusiastic about the brand. My guess is it took them a while to understand what customers what in these categories and how to market to them. This will make the business less seasonal and increase revenue, margins, and income.\nFurthermore, there is legitimate speculation (https://x.com/NonGaap/status/1757928725608530307?s=20) that the company is about to be acquired. The largest shareholder of GOOS is Bain Capital and they own almost 40% of the company. Recently Bain Capital started moving their shares into a shell company that looks like it was used to take out a margin loan against their shares. As the shares have dropped in value, they had to post more and more shares as collateral for that debt. They are getting close to running out of shares to post.\nAt the same time, Bain Capital have changed their appointed director on the board and \"appointed an experienced operating partner [Beth Clymer - formerly at Bain Capital] to run point on finance & strategy.\" (quote from the tweet above) GOOS acquired their European supplier shortly after the new board member and Beth were appointed. Now the company has full vertical integration internationally. These are not coincidences. Bain needs an exit and the company is cheap and ripe (in terms of inflection point) for acquisition.\nBut fuck the probability of an acquisition and let's say I'm too optimistic about its future. The company hasn't taken on any additional long term debt since way before COVID. They will grow their revenue 10% in a year that most luxury brands will struggle to not shrink. Not to mention that it was a really warm winter. They are cashflow positive almost every year since IPO (including this year). They have bought back more than 10% of the company since going public. They grew revenue every year by double digits since IPO except for 2020 (COVID) despite all the challenging factors I listed above. Revenue, income, and cashflow are all up more than 3x since IPO.  The CEO is a grandson of the founder and owns almost 25% of the company. And somehow their market cap is below what it was when they IPO'd? Wtf? I rest my case.\n",

I\u2019m getting in to trading options myself and I am wondering why I don\u2019t hear more about straddles/strangles* (thank you u/KAY-toe for the right terms) here? \nIt seems like alot of y\u2019all deal with volatile stocks for the most part. I\u2019m curious if anyone has tried buying calls and puts against a stock at the same time during very volatile trading weeks (like this week.) \nExample: \nTSLA fell hard this week - but it\u2019s impossible to know for sure if this is the true bottom, or if it will suddenly shoot back up next week as people try to buy the dip. \nSince it\u2019s likely to swing hard either way next week - why not buy both calls and puts on it? \nSet limits so that you auto sell at 2x investment, or if it falls below 1.5x investment. \nObviously one will fail, but it\u2019s unlikely that both will fail. And assuming it does work out, you\u2019re likely to at least break even, if not profit quite a bit depending on how far the stock swings either way. \nThe only way it seems like you\u2019d lose major money is if the stock has a relatively flat week. But there\u2019s many popular stocks here where flat weeks don\u2019t seem to be that common. \nObviously you\u2019d make less per stock but at volume maybe it would be statistically safer?\nJust curious if anyone has experience with this strategy (if it could be called that at all.) \n*Edit: \nI am talking about Straddle/Strangles, not Saddles.

Bullishness and speculative behavior exploded like Tuco's temper. Financial conditions loosened to the extent that now we have the easiest money since before interest rate hikes even began!\nJpow observes the party getting out of hand, and as we all know, it is the Fed's job to take the meth laced peace pipe out of the circle just as the party is getting started. Loose financial conditions have led to a resurgence in inflation. And not just consumer facing inflation, but producer price inflation too, which leads the consumer rate, since price increases flow down the production chain.\nSo now he's thinking well fuck. If I wait to fix this fuckup too long, inflation risks running away again, and then someone will take my smug, private equity mask off and show the world I was Burns this whole time. He doesn't want to raise rates because the US government can't keep high interest rates and high debt loads forever. So he's going to fuck your calls. \nWednesday afternoon, he's coming out maximum hawkish. Like Jackson Hole hawkish. He knows if he doesn't he'll miss the last free opportunity to tighten financial conditions without a rate hike. \nIf he has to choose between a guaranteed stagflationary hard landing and a 20% haircut in indexes, he'll take the latter every time. \nPosition: 2,250 shares of $DOG, $31.49 avg.

I say created because every formula I use to calculate my shit is self-made. My math isn't perfect yet. I'm also NOT a financial advisor. Please don't take this as advice.\nTL;DR. Basically, I sell call credit spreads way out of the money on earnings week on stocks that aren't really great based on traditional technical analysis. If you don't know how this works, or how to do technical analysis, that's a completely separate chunk of information. Some may call this \"picking up pennies in front of a steamroller\" but I wouldn't call what I'm making \" pennies.\" and I wouldn't call stocks like Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and Ulta Beauty \"steamrollers\", but ok.\nOk, ready? Good. I'm gonna post this picture - my model - and explain what each line means. Then, I'm gonna explain how I use the info.\nCall Credit Spread Model - 3/18 - 3/22\n\nLine 1-3: Stock Info. This should be self-explanatory. The O/price avg is the sum of the at the midpoint of the at the money (ATM) call and ATM put. I use this to calculate the Implied movement (IM) in line 8.\nLine 4-7: Credit Spread Info. This is info on the actual credit spread I'm potentially going to sell. SL=Price of the Short Leg; LL=Price of the Long Leg; Premium = how much premium I expect to get for selling the spread. SL Delta = Delta of the short leg. SL Delta is important because, for many mathematical reasons, it tells you the rough probability of your buyer being successful. ex. LULU 585/595 the buyer would have a 4% chance of being successful. I use the short leg because if the price of the stock goes above my short leg, I start to lose money, and that's no bueno.\nLine 8-11: Stats. These are where I start to use my own formulas to determine whether I actually think it's a good idea. Gain = % portfolio gain expected if you sell the spread and win. IM = Implied Movement of the stock during earnings week. % to loss = how much the stock has to go up to cross the short leg and lose money. IM/Loss Ratio = how many times more than the IM the stock would have to move to cross my short leg.\nLine 12-14: My Scores. My safety score is calculated using by weighing the Delta and IM/loss ratio, taking into account the width of the spread as a percentage of the stock price. It's not out of 100, but the higher the better. My Risk/Reward Score is based on the mathematical concept of fair wagering based on the odds of loss. ex. if a wager is 50/50, the winner should receive back 200% of their wager; however, in a 90/10 wager, The one with a 90% chance to win should receive back only 111.1% of their wager. I use the inverse of the delta to determine the \"ideal\" reward (options are never ideal) and compare it to the actual reward for selling the spread. This one IS out of 100, So that LULU 585/595 spread is 71.7% of ideal.\nMisc. If you really want to know what this is, you can probably figure it out. I use it more in my put selling model. Also, I have META listed as a control, since sometimes earnings stocks can be weird, just to make sure my model is working correctly.\n\nOk, so every weekend, I compile my list, then, I take the ones with the best \"Dave Score\" (I wasn't planning on posting this, so I didn't get too creative) and go look at the stock. Generally, If I am actually bearish on a stock, I'll pull the trigger Monday at open. If I am generally bullish on the stock, I pull the trigger as close to the closing bell before they report earnings. Why? If a stock has bullish momentum, the IV is gonna skyrocket exponentially until the report, and the stock is likely to go up pre-earnings too. So, it's better to wait.\nYou might ask: Why do you use a bearish strategy even if you're bullish? Simple. People are regarded. They pay way too fucking much for options the week of earnings. If someone is willing to pay for call options 30% out of the money on an overvalued company, who am I to deny them? 1 or 2 out of 100 times, they win. That's why I use that analysis to decide which ones are most likely to win for me. And indeed, I have won. All of them. About 25 total trades in a row out of 70-ish that I've analyzed. ONE of those 70 would have lost (DELL). But my model saw it coming, so i stayed away. I've made anywhere from 3-15% per week depending on how many of these I run per week. I started almost 3 months ago.\nThis is how my model looked when it was just a baby about a month ago - before I optimized it and did primarily earnings.\nMy first real model\nMy Model V2.\nIf any of you are planning on buying these LULU calls from me, I suggest not doing it.\nWhy call credit spreads and not put credit spreads? Because people are generally bullish on literally everything.\nWill this eventually fail? Mathematically, yes. Over a long enough timeframe and enough samples, anything will fail. That's why I made the model, to keep me as far away from failure as possible until I have enough money to have financial freedom. Hopefully I only have to do this a couple more months. It's not sustainable forever. Should you do it? It's not guaranteed, but sure, I don't care. If you want to use my model this week, go ahead.\nIf you have questions, DM me. If you want me to make a course so you can buy it from me, DM me. I'm not gonna make a course, but it will make me laugh.\nGood luck and happy trading.\nEDIT: Please stop swamping my DMs asking for a copy of my spreadsheet. I\u2019ve spent weeks on it and it\u2019s not even finished. I\u2019m not prepared to give it away right now, sorry. \n",

            "text": "Hello fellow regards, I went full regard on NVDA, TSM calls for next week GTC and TSM earnings in a month. Planning to get rid of NVDA calls after GTC if there is a high jump in the stock and it reaches 975-1000 level. For TSM, not sure if I am holding until earnings or selling before, I'll see based on how the stock moves. They should have their March earnings report come out too so that could be a good catalyst if it is good. Might lose some money of 200/220 4/19c's but those were bought just to have more shares to control for cheaper never meant to be held until expiration. \nAlong with these, I also jumped on the MSTR hype train with the short squeeze going on and the stock growing parabolic due to HF's having to buying the stock back to cut their losses. Was planning to sell this before the weekend to avoid theta, was 1k up on the call too but did not have my device to sell it so couldnt go thru with it. Planning to get out of it this week if MSTR does really good, else might try to breakeven if not.\nI also got some ORCL calls for their earnings. Since they were far OTM they got IV crushed. I was up 1k on them at one point but decided to hold for the NVDA conference due to their \"exciting partnership with NVDA in upcoming week\" announcement. Will sell the 140c's if the stock goes high due to the announcement, might get rid of most of 150c's too but will hold onto 160c's I think.\nWhat do you guys think, this yolo is gonna work? Which of these calls are gonna/not gonna print? Its either lambo or wendy's imo, I have my 60% my port in this play so hopefully it plays out.\n",

            "text": "In general, this sub is not a fan of using technical analysis to help guide options decisions. I was skeptical as well - I mean, looking at charts with a million imaginary lines drawn on it reminded me of Charlie and pepe silvia. Looked to me like people were drawing conclusions from imaginary data while thinking they were smarter than they really are. It also didn\u2019t help that the technical analysis often failed. \nUnfortunately, this logic is flawed for a few reasons. First of all, no trader that religiously uses TA would say their strategy is 100%. Losses happen, trends are broken, and there are plenty of variables that technical analysis cannot cover. The goal is to be better than 50%, which would have prevented many of you regards from moving in behind the Wendy\u2019s dumpster. \nSecondly, why would it be a bad thing to have more data at your disposal to help make decisions? If you choose to ignore the data and trends, that\u2019s up to you. But it will never hurt to understand the bets we\u2019re making a little better. Much of the loss porn on here come from positions that made little sense from a technical analysis perspective. \nI guess it comes down to what a trader\u2019s goal is. If they want to gamble and make speculative bets, carry on. But personally, I would like to consistently trade profitability. After all, wouldn\u2019t this sub be better if we were known for skilled plays instead of being regarded enough to populate every wendy\u2019s dumpster? The sub needs to win its wife back from her boyfriend. \n",

            "text": "Hi Regards,\nI'll just go ahead and dive in head first:\nI've been cooking up an options trading strategy focused on the earnings reports, and I'm laying it all out here, looking for your legendary insights, roasts, and wisdom. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\nThe Core of My Strategy:\n1. It's all about playing call options around earnings reports, targeting companies 2-3 weeks out from their big day. Puts? Nah, they're off the table due to less appealing risk/reward vibes considering capped earnings potential. If anything I would only revisit that idea in june where that seems to be the least ER releases.\n2. Keeping an eye on the VIX (and put-call ratio + a/d line) to gauge market mood swings. A high VIX might spell out more opportunities, but it's also sus.\n3. 200-day MA is my compass, guiding me through the stock's trend. Plus, comparing the stock's current stance against analyst price targets to sniff out underpriced gems. I am thinking of using Earnings Wisper. (because I'm not using my crack money)\n4. Timing is the key \u2013 I plan to exit just before earnings are announced. Trying to sidestep the \"sell the news\" trap that seems to catch the crowd off-guard and gain on the anticipation and the new open interest driving the calls price up. Only need +50%.\n5. With a starting war chest of $1,600, I'm throwing in an additional $1k each month. Targeting a 5% risk per trade, eyeing a 1.5 risk-reward ratio. Aiming for up to 12 trades a month, given that not every week is Christmas during earnings season.\nThis strategy isn't set in stone. I\u2019m on a quest for knowledge\nWhat I'm Looking For:\n\nYour Experience: Ever danced this dance before? How'd it go?\nPitfalls: Any \"gotchas\" or common traps I might be overlooking?\nOptimization Tips: How can I sharpen my strategy? Any tools, indicators, or resources you swear by?\n\nI'm all ears and ready to learn from the best (and the worst). This is essentially everything i have learned from trading maybe ~3 months every day on SPY and losing money so I wanted to try something new.\n! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udfb2\n",

            "text": "As of midday Friday, the S&P 500 index had declined just 0.2% for the week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%.\nWhile stocks didn\u2019t freak out about inflation, other financial markets certainly reacted. The federal-funds futures market reflects just a 58% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates at least once\u2014by July. At the end of December, there was a 75% chance of at least one cut by March.\nWhat\u2019s more, the two-year Treasury yield, a barometer for expectations about the fed-funds rate, is up more than 30 basis points for the year, to 4.7%. The last time it was at this level, in early December, the S&P 500 was 11% lower. (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.)\nThe stock market is ignoring these troublesome signals\u2014and the Fed may have to provide a wake-up call at its monetary policy meeting, which ends this coming Wednesday. Almost no one expects the Fed to actually do anything\u2014there\u2019s a 99% chance it leaves rates right where they are\u2014but it\u2019s the signals about the future investors should worry about. The current \u201cdot plot\u201d suggests three cuts this year, but it\u2019s possible that could change.\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s policy meeting next week could be a highly consequential one,\u201d writes Thierry Wizman, global foreign exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie, who notes it could \u201cformally extend the wait-and-see period.\u201d\nIf the Fed officially dashes hopes of rate cuts this year, the market would be, well, unthrilled. \u201cWe expect price action to be quite volatile as we believe that investors are placing too much emphasis on the timing and magnitude of potential Fed rate cuts, with market expectations and Fed speak seemingly at odds at the current moment,\u201d writes Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cWe do not view the current pace of U.S. stock market gains as sustainable.\u201d\nThe counterargument is that, under the surface, the market is showing signs that it can remain hot. More than 60% of stocks on the S&P 500 have notched gains this year, according to FactSet, so the index isn\u2019t so reliant on a handful of Big Tech names to stay afloat. With inflation still pretty hot and commodity prices up this past week, the index\u2019s energy and materials sectors gained. Even consumer staples, which broadly have strong pricing power, are flat for the week, outperforming the index.\nWill the Fed finally spark a rotation that causes the market to sink? We\u2019re about to find out.\n",
