I myself have lived a life of stock market sin, but I've come to the light and I want others to see the truth as well. \nIn this sub we have come to glorify massive gains and colossal losses \ud83d\udcc9.  The typical person here would seem to have a 5-10k dollar Robinhood account, which they eagerly are willing to risk most of on a random earnings event, overnighting weeklies, or dca-ing 0dte against the market until their account reaches -99%. \nWhat if it didn't have to be this way? What if someone with a 5-10k cash account could average 100-200 bucks a day in gains rather than just going all or nothing? They would only take 25-100 trading days to double up with a more measured approach to trading. \nHow? Well, how about for starters: \n1) Weeklies and 0dte are for scalping, not swinging. Yes, when you see COIN or NVDA or whatever the fuck stock you suck yourself off to has a good setup on the intraday: you scalp that shit. You buy a weekly and sit there until you've made a little money and you throw the option back into the sea \ud83c\udf0a after like 10-30 minutes.  \n2) Swinging has a clean technical setup. So, say we want to enter a trade against QQQ in this bull market. The trend is already against it. Would it make more sense to enter short if it was stalling out at like 445 where you would have a closer logical stop, or 434 where you're just jerking yourself off hoping the last 6 months of trend support will break? Praise God. \ud83d\udc4f  \n3) You can accept a loss and you know where you'll take it when you enter a trade. A general rule I've learned in the futures trading community is you never will let a single day take out more than 3 days of your average gains. Preferably less, but we are in the business of risking it for the biscuit so sometimes shit happens. Say you made 200 for the last 5 days, and the next day you get fucked for 600, you're still up 400 and your mental has probably taken a hit but it's better than if you took your account from 5k to 12k overnight then toileted the entire account dca-ing spy puts against an uptrend day. Then you just won't be feeling good about shit for a couple months rather than a day or two.   \nThat's just 3 simple things, my fellow degens. We're here to make money, not fund the local hedge fund manager's next visit to a brothel.\n",

I have been consistently trading from a long time. I do follow all the news. Understand all the options strategies, and a lot of finance terms. I listen to fed calls every week, listen to podcasts, earnings calls. And I can guess direction pretty well too.\nLast few weeks I have been sleeping less and less but wake up every day an hour before markets do analysis and I am right on the  general direction at least 60% -70% of the time. I bet calls on Appl, google, when they were at their lows but sold out at small profits. Next day google runs 6% up. \nI trade well on high volatility days. Make some profit and stop. And out of nowhere, I don\u2019t know what happens, as soon as i go into a position bigger than I ever normally do on a 0dte markets tend to go tits up in the other direction. \nAnd the only SPY/ qqq positions I lost big were puts at 0dte. The first time I lost over 30k in a single day spy went up my option was worth .06 and I was ITM again in 2020. And now I keep buying puts and it just runs the other direction. \nLike today\u2019s rally, why ? I know markets go up and down. Today, it\u2019s not just NVDA, every sector went up and the inflows too were pretty intense. like my NvDA calls today I exited at a loss even as the price went up. \nI don\u2019t know why end up in this position after going through so much trash analysts interviews and readings. I miss out on big profits and take 90% of full losses . \nDo you guys never trade big naked option positions. I see some people make wins out of literal crazy bets I want to get fricking 50% win a couple of times. Where you buy something and it goes in your direction not against you. \nDo you guys only trade spreads and iron condors ? Or just stocks? How is it working for you? Please help! This is just insane how I spend months together, take incredible stress and time and keep loosing more. What am I missing?\n",
