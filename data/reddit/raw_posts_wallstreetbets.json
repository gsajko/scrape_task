He tells me how BTC saved him when he bought in at $16 and cashed out most around $600 for various things, that he got cheated out of property by in laws but that his stache kept him afloat.\nThe Parking lot Prophet of Profit has spoken. It is either your buy signal from above, or your sell signal.\nI've been in BTC since 2017, but never have I ever had an actual random person on the street try to evangelize me on buying Bitcoin.\n",

They are firing lots of people, not renewing visa, raising prices (in some cases x10 or x20), selling parts of the company, etc.\nVmware is THE on premises virtualization company. If you still run non cloud (most big organizations do), then there is a very high chance you depend on vmware. \nThe rasing prices is not the only issue, you know there will be no good development, support is going to be a mess, etc...\nSince 1 month ago that this started everybody is going crazy looking for alternatives to run away from vmware, all vendors calling...\nNutanix is the best enterprise ready alternative, the other option is going full cloud (aws, azure,etc.), most companies won't do that due to many reasons (capex vs opex, latency, regulatory requirements, etc.). \nThe price raise will start soon, I predict it will get full attention after the next quarter results in a couple of months. \nDo your due diligence...\n",
