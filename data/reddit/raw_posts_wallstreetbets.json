            "text": "Hello fellow regards, I went full regard on NVDA, TSM calls for next week GTC and TSM earnings in a month. Planning to get rid of NVDA calls after GTC if there is a high jump in the stock and it reaches 975-1000 level. For TSM, not sure if I am holding until earnings or selling before, I'll see based on how the stock moves. They should have their March earnings report come out too so that could be a good catalyst if it is good. Might lose some money of 200/220 4/19c's but those were bought just to have more shares to control for cheaper never meant to be held until expiration. \nAlong with these, I also jumped on the MSTR hype train with the short squeeze going on and the stock growing parabolic due to HF's having to buying the stock back to cut their losses. Was planning to sell this before the weekend to avoid theta, was 1k up on the call too but did not have my device to sell it so couldnt go thru with it. Planning to get out of it this week if MSTR does really good, else might try to breakeven if not.\nI also got some ORCL calls for their earnings. Since they were far OTM they got IV crushed. I was up 1k on them at one point but decided to hold for the NVDA conference due to their \"exciting partnership with NVDA in upcoming week\" announcement. Will sell the 140c's if the stock goes high due to the announcement, might get rid of most of 150c's too but will hold onto 160c's I think.\nWhat do you guys think, this yolo is gonna work? Which of these calls are gonna/not gonna print? Its either lambo or wendy's imo, I have my 60% my port in this play so hopefully it plays out.\n",

            "text": "In general, this sub is not a fan of using technical analysis to help guide options decisions. I was skeptical as well - I mean, looking at charts with a million imaginary lines drawn on it reminded me of Charlie and pepe silvia. Looked to me like people were drawing conclusions from imaginary data while thinking they were smarter than they really are. It also didn\u2019t help that the technical analysis often failed. \nUnfortunately, this logic is flawed for a few reasons. First of all, no trader that religiously uses TA would say their strategy is 100%. Losses happen, trends are broken, and there are plenty of variables that technical analysis cannot cover. The goal is to be better than 50%, which would have prevented many of you regards from moving in behind the Wendy\u2019s dumpster. \nSecondly, why would it be a bad thing to have more data at your disposal to help make decisions? If you choose to ignore the data and trends, that\u2019s up to you. But it will never hurt to understand the bets we\u2019re making a little better. Much of the loss porn on here come from positions that made little sense from a technical analysis perspective. \nI guess it comes down to what a trader\u2019s goal is. If they want to gamble and make speculative bets, carry on. But personally, I would like to consistently trade profitability. After all, wouldn\u2019t this sub be better if we were known for skilled plays instead of being regarded enough to populate every wendy\u2019s dumpster? The sub needs to win its wife back from her boyfriend. \n",

            "text": "Hi Regards,\nI'll just go ahead and dive in head first:\nI've been cooking up an options trading strategy focused on the earnings reports, and I'm laying it all out here, looking for your legendary insights, roasts, and wisdom. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\nThe Core of My Strategy:\n1. It's all about playing call options around earnings reports, targeting companies 2-3 weeks out from their big day. Puts? Nah, they're off the table due to less appealing risk/reward vibes considering capped earnings potential. If anything I would only revisit that idea in june where that seems to be the least ER releases.\n2. Keeping an eye on the VIX (and put-call ratio + a/d line) to gauge market mood swings. A high VIX might spell out more opportunities, but it's also sus.\n3. 200-day MA is my compass, guiding me through the stock's trend. Plus, comparing the stock's current stance against analyst price targets to sniff out underpriced gems. I am thinking of using Earnings Wisper. (because I'm not using my crack money)\n4. Timing is the key \u2013 I plan to exit just before earnings are announced. Trying to sidestep the \"sell the news\" trap that seems to catch the crowd off-guard and gain on the anticipation and the new open interest driving the calls price up. Only need +50%.\n5. With a starting war chest of $1,600, I'm throwing in an additional $1k each month. Targeting a 5% risk per trade, eyeing a 1.5 risk-reward ratio. Aiming for up to 12 trades a month, given that not every week is Christmas during earnings season.\nThis strategy isn't set in stone. I\u2019m on a quest for knowledge\nWhat I'm Looking For:\n\nYour Experience: Ever danced this dance before? How'd it go?\nPitfalls: Any \"gotchas\" or common traps I might be overlooking?\nOptimization Tips: How can I sharpen my strategy? Any tools, indicators, or resources you swear by?\n\nI'm all ears and ready to learn from the best (and the worst). This is essentially everything i have learned from trading maybe ~3 months every day on SPY and losing money so I wanted to try something new.\n! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udfb2\n",

            "text": "As of midday Friday, the S&P 500 index had declined just 0.2% for the week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%.\nWhile stocks didn\u2019t freak out about inflation, other financial markets certainly reacted. The federal-funds futures market reflects just a 58% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates at least once\u2014by July. At the end of December, there was a 75% chance of at least one cut by March.\nWhat\u2019s more, the two-year Treasury yield, a barometer for expectations about the fed-funds rate, is up more than 30 basis points for the year, to 4.7%. The last time it was at this level, in early December, the S&P 500 was 11% lower. (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.)\nThe stock market is ignoring these troublesome signals\u2014and the Fed may have to provide a wake-up call at its monetary policy meeting, which ends this coming Wednesday. Almost no one expects the Fed to actually do anything\u2014there\u2019s a 99% chance it leaves rates right where they are\u2014but it\u2019s the signals about the future investors should worry about. The current \u201cdot plot\u201d suggests three cuts this year, but it\u2019s possible that could change.\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s policy meeting next week could be a highly consequential one,\u201d writes Thierry Wizman, global foreign exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie, who notes it could \u201cformally extend the wait-and-see period.\u201d\nIf the Fed officially dashes hopes of rate cuts this year, the market would be, well, unthrilled. \u201cWe expect price action to be quite volatile as we believe that investors are placing too much emphasis on the timing and magnitude of potential Fed rate cuts, with market expectations and Fed speak seemingly at odds at the current moment,\u201d writes Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cWe do not view the current pace of U.S. stock market gains as sustainable.\u201d\nThe counterargument is that, under the surface, the market is showing signs that it can remain hot. More than 60% of stocks on the S&P 500 have notched gains this year, according to FactSet, so the index isn\u2019t so reliant on a handful of Big Tech names to stay afloat. With inflation still pretty hot and commodity prices up this past week, the index\u2019s energy and materials sectors gained. Even consumer staples, which broadly have strong pricing power, are flat for the week, outperforming the index.\nWill the Fed finally spark a rotation that causes the market to sink? We\u2019re about to find out.\n",

            "text": "The outlook for the U.S. economy in 2024 presents a complex picture, characterized by a mix of cautious optimism and emerging challenges. The economy is expected to see a slowdown in growth, but with a potential for a soft landing, indicating a more moderate pace of expansion without entering a recession. Here\u2019s a synthesis of the key points from several sources:\n1.  Economic Growth: The U.S. economy is likely to experience deceleration in 2024 as the effects of monetary policy become more pronounced and post-pandemic tailwinds diminish. Real GDP growth is forecasted to slow down, with consumer spending expected to increase at a more subdued rate. Business investment and housing activity might see some improvement but will likely remain muted due to higher interest rates .\n2.  Federal Reserve Policies: The Federal Reserve\u2019s policy rates are expected to be on hold at 5.25%-5.5% until the middle of 2024. Subsequently, assuming inflation continues its moderating trajectory, there might be rate cuts starting in June, aiming for a target range of 4.00%-4.25% by the end of 2024 .\n3.  Consumer Spending and Labor Markets: Consumer spending growth is expected to slow down due to factors like diminished excess savings and plateauing wage gains. However, the tight labor market continues to support employment and income levels, suggesting that consumer spending growth, while slower, could remain positive. The labor market is showing signs of normalization, with unemployment potentially drifting higher but staying low in a historical context .\n4.  Inflation and Interest Rates: Inflation is expected to continue its steady downward trend, with forecasts suggesting 2% growth, 2% inflation, and an unemployment rate staying at roughly 4%. The demand in the economy is gradually easing following a strong 2023, but consumer spending is expected to grow more slowly as job gains diminish and banks tighten lending standards [oai_citation:4,\n\nU.S. economy: Hoping for a boring 2024\n| J.P. Morgan Asset Management\n4.  ](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/investment-outlook/us-economic-outlook/).\n5.  Risks and Challenges: The factors that have driven the resilience of the U.S. economy in 2023, such as robust consumer spending and financial liquidity, could recede in 2024. This poses risks to the bullish outlook on U.S. stocks, highlighting the need for caution among investors regarding high equity valuations and the potential for interest rates to remain higher for longer .\n\nTLDR\u2026 the U.S. economy in 2024 is poised for a year of moderated growth and potential soft landing, with a focus on managing inflation and interest rates. Challenges such as slowing consumer spending and the impact of higher interest rates on investment and housing will require careful navigation, but there are also opportunities for positive outcomes if policy measures are effectively implemented.\n",

This whole year we went from pricing in 7 rate cuts to now 3 and the market still has gone up. Will it make a difference if we go from 3 to potentially 2? I don't think so.\nJerome has been dovish for a while now. He seems to be confident that inflation is still trending down and insists that rate cuts will happen before hitting the 2% target. I don't expect him to suddenly turn hawkish. He will likely use words like \"bumpy\" to describe path of inflation meaning he believes these recent readings are kind of a fluke or blame lags in housing.\nThere is absolutely no way we get a sell off from FOMC, or I will ban myself permanently from this sub.\n",

In fact you\u2019ll probably lose it all on the very next trade. Stop saying \u201cI got greedy\u2026\u201d when you were greedy from the start.\nHere is a normal options position. It\u2019s not sexy. It\u2019s not going to make me rich over night. It just hedges a portion of my portfolio against an anticipated market downturn, and if it doesn\u2019t hit, it\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019d actually prefer it that way.\n",
