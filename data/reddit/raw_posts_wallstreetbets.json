            "text": "This is to discuss the short opportunity of trumps new truth social listing. Not interested in discussing his politics or other actions in this one. It\u2019s had me thinking about it for days on end and if nothing else, maybe sharing it will help me understand why I\u2019m wrong\u2026\nThat said, I want to state some trump facts about his prior years that are relevant.\n1. He managed to drag out the Atlantic city bankruptcy for many years. It first entered bankruptcy in 1990 and kept going until 2009 with trump. 2016 it shut doors properly.\n2. Over this time trump took about $75 million in todays dollars as wages for his 14 years with the company\n3. Trump doesn\u2019t need to use truth social exclusively after July of this year and doesn\u2019t have to inform the market until July that he\u2019ll stop.\nNow truth social\nThe forecast 2022 November\n- 56 million users by 2024\n- 7.50 average revenue per user\nThat\u2019s $420 million a year in revenue forecast for this year.\n- it was 226 million of revenue forecast for last year (2023)\nThis explains the current value as $420 million x an arbitrary Price earnings of 8 = $3.3 billion market cap.\nThe actual numbers\n-  active users of 607,000 (some estimates as high as 5 million)\n- revenue of $2 million last year (100% from a related party)\n-average revenue per user of $0.44 per user.\n- loss of $30 million in the last six months (mainly interest expenses of $22 million).\n- $12 mil in loans from a Russian associated to the Alex smirnov informant that appears to be a Russian agent (only mentioning as potential legal issue).\nThe merger gives the combined company cash reserve of about $250 million.\nAssuming losses of 30 million every six months or 60 million a year, the company has 4 years until definitive bankruptcy.\nThe future.\nLet\u2019s consider all of the above.\nY\u2019all know it\u2019s not looking good from the above but what are the possibilities? From most to least optimistic below\n1. Truth social gets 80 million subscribers with arpu of $5.00. This would give it revenue of $400 million and profit of around $100 million per year assuming costs are similar pinterest.\n2. Same as above but trump gets extra wages ect to friends and takes a commission = $50 million a year in profit for shareholders\n3. Stagnation \u2014> bankrupt in 4 years\n4. Stagnation + trump takes money for legal bills+friends \u2014> bankrupt in 2 years\n5. Legal issues. The Russian loans and what appears to be a failure to update the market on the terrible state of the business could potentially enable shareholders who purchased DWAC to sue and take trump media cash/shares from current shareholders.\n6. Legal issues existing - there are legal issues existing with co founders that may stand to cause dilution of other shareholders pending their outcome.\n7. Trump stops using truth social as his primary account in July to keep his presidential dream alive and the share price tanks like a lead balloon.\nTo summarise. \nIn the best situation, DWAC grows 100 x in the next year and is possibly worth the current market capitalisation. \nMost likely, in 6-12 months, trump cashes out then stops using the app and any remaining shareholders get screwed. Similar to Atlantic city.\nThere are a range of other possibilities that all seem bad for DWAC shareholders.\nFor these reasons, my thesis is short sell DWAC now and cover in 6 months.\nWhat y\u2019all think of the thesis and do you know a good way to short these shares? I.e. a broker like Robin Hood?\n",

Mature profitable companies like Microsoft command 10x sales/ 30x earnings multiples. Reddit will eventually monetize. I expect 20% to 30% revenue growth - that should justify 20x sales multiple. \nHigh Growth ahead: ARPU is very low compared to $META $SNAP $PINS. User growth should be faster than all. Already signed $60m/yr licensing deal with $GOOGL, that locks in 7% growth already. 20% to 30% long term grower.\nUniqueness: lots of pr0n. No other stock is hosting pr0n. \nMeme Potential: IPO lockup next 6 months. \nPrice Target: $100 at 20x P/S, $500 if it memes.\nRisks: Reddit might not be able to monetize. Meta makes a copycat. \nBottomline: Buy for the value, stay for the memes.\n",

They're evolving beautifully, and something even more compelling has emerged on the weekly chart: a classic Adam and Eve double bottom pattern. This isn't just any pattern \u2013 it's known for its power in signaling bullish reversals, and it's especially significant when it appears on a longer-term timeframe like a weekly chart.\n\nAdam's Dive (Nov 2023): That sharp drop formed the first bottom (Adam).\nEve's Softer Landing (Feb 2024): A rounder, gradual bottom (Eve) suggests buyers are stepping back in.\nThe Rarity Factor: Adam and Eve patterns don't show up every day, and their presence on a weekly chart makes this one even more significant.\nMomentum Divergence & More: The other signals (divergence, Heikin Ashi, money flow) are still backing this up.\n\nCrucial Breakout Needed:  For true confirmation, we need a decisive close above the high of $115.97 (from Jan 8th, 2024).\nWeekly MRNA Chart\nThe News Backs It Up\nRemember that Merck/Moderna skin cancer vaccine update? The market does \u2013 and it seems to love the Adam and Eve setup forming alongside this news. And while those declining COVID booster numbers sting for some, Moderna's superior efficacy and revolutionary technology shines brighter than ever.  Moreover, notable investors like Cathie Wood have stepped up their position in MRNA noted in an an article ironically titled, \"Is Cathie Wood Buying the Rumor?\" (Welcome to the party Cathie).\nMy Money's Where My Chart Is\nI've been building my MRNA position, and the technicals suggest it's not too late to join in. Let's be real, institutions aren't panicking \u2013  which is usually a good sign for us contrarians.\nAs always, don't take my word for it...noted technical analyst Thomas Bulkowski has a lot to say about the Adam & Eve pattern here...https://thepatternsite.com/aedb.html\nChaikin Money Flow Increasing\n",

That is DESPITE the fact that almost all of them have beat earnings in Q4 2023.\nThe problem is guidance.\nNKE went double down TWICE. First in December when they posted weak guidance. Then again just yesterday. They beat earnings estimates both times. They're down about 23% since their December earnings call. Again, despite beating earnings on both quarters.\nFL fell off a cliff, down 30% since their earnings (also weak guidance, but they also fucked up earnings).\nLULU RIP on weak guidance (down 16% since their call yesterday).\nConsumer confidence was high at the holiday season, but it's come back down to reality. January consumer spending shocked to the downside. February consumer spending was lower than expectations.\nJanuary CPI print was higher than expected.\nFebruary CPI was higher than expected.\nMarch CPI gonna be fucked. Look around, gas prices going up, war in the middle east, Red Sea shipping and insurance prices have gone up.\nConsumer confidence is fucked. People are sobering up to the reality that inflation is here to stay, even if JPow does a wink-wink, 3 rate cuts this year. If March CPI is fucked, that goes out the window too.\n--\n\u200b\nNow, let's look at RL. Surely, it should be down given all of these macro concerns for consumer discretionary, the american consumer (as evidenced by LULU guidance with softening NA sales).\nNOPE. about 2% off the all time high (192) sitting at $197.60 (and that's after a 1.5% down day).\n\u200b\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9r0dqm4tlypc1.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1fb93229003a97d2ef26070a6589dede588a3f5\nThis is the MF'ing chart. It's up 28.47% YTD. It's trading like a tech AI stock. But it ain't.\nNotice that cliff at $170 to $140. If it falls, especially on bad earnings & guidance, it'll fall through that floor.\nEarnings is anticipated some time between May 21st and May 24th. Unfortunately the options for this ticker are monthly and quarterly (not weekly), so the May monthly options will be just short of the earnings date. I've got puts for June at $150.\nIgnore the P/L unrealized losses. I opened these today, at basically the stock's ATH. The reason it's marked down is because of the wide B/S spread at the end of the day. \n",

This is a reduction in time between halvings and the beginning of a genuine bull run of 43.3%. If we were to see this occur again in 2024, that would mean that there will be 69.7 days between the halving and the beginning of a bull run, placing it around June 29th, 2024 (presuming the halving occurs on the estimated date of April 20th). Make of this what you will.\nNote: we didn't have ETFs, MSTR, and some of the other shit that we do now, when the previous halvings occurred. I don't know what that means, precisely. I would guess that it will reduce the space in between the halving and the next bull run even more, but I don't know that, obviously.\nEdit: I didn't bother with the 1st halving because that was so early on that almost nobody knew what bitcoin was, let alone bothered with it.\n",

            "text": "Hey fellow degenerates,\nLet me take you back to a simpler time, Dec 2020 - Jan 2021, when I, a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed newbie, decided to dive headfirst into the murky waters of options trading. Armed with nothing but the Robinhood app and dreams of Lambos, I embarked on what can only be described as a financial roller-coaster.\nIn the span of a little over a month, I managed to execute 36 trades. My instruments of choice? Calls on LUCID, \"stock-that-shall-not-be-named\", and PMC. Yes, I was riding the meme stock wave, hoping to surf my way to untold riches. Spoiler alert: it didn't go as planned.\nHere's the breakdown:\n\nTotal Gains: $30,000\nTotal Losses: $50,000\n\nAs you can see below, I had a win rate of about 50%. Not too shabby for a rookie, right? Wrong. Because amidst these battles, there was one day, January 25th, that will forever be etched in my memory. \nOn that fateful day, I managed to lose $25,000 in a matter of minutes, as the short squeeze came to an abrupt end when Robinhood decided to halt options trading. This was equivalent of my 6 months pay at that time. And poof, just like that, it was gone! \nI literally had a GUH moment and I remember my hands trembling in disbelief that I was down $25,000 in less than 2 minutes . I don't play poker or gamble otherwise, so this shock was particularly severe and I did what any rational person would do - I deleted the Robinhood app and tried to erase the entire episode from my mind!\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uur971t0mxpc1.png?width=455&format=png&auto=webp&s=311803a1920eb8d4a5068d7ca2dee734f5ec90bb\nFor three long years, I avoided confronting the reality of what happened. But today, I mustered the courage to look back at my Robinhood history and reconcile with my past.\nWhy am I sharing this story on here, you ask? Because it's cathartic and today was the first day I'm seeing all these trades after 3 years of being away from robinhood. Now that I look back, I think had I not lost $25,000 on that day, I would have probably continued to make bigger and bigger bets until I finally lost it all. Typical gambler's fallacy. \nThe $25K lesson I learned was trite but very humbling - NEVER play with more than what you can afford to lose! Which also means YOLOs are out of the question. \n",

            "text": "We are in a market where a company like LULU that increased profits 400% YoY dumps -20% because it didn't outperform its massive outperformance. We're pricing everything like its Nvidia, so when a company merely does great (comparatively) and isn't 3x'ing every quarter the speculation deflates so quickly ON POSITIVE EARNINGS. When we are at the point where stock prices reflect speculation on exponential future growth, any indication of slow down IN GROWTH collapses a stock, thats how you know we are in a bubble. With an astronomical P/E in the 60's before today, 16% Sales Growth YoY isn't enough in this market. I think LULU is just a demonstration of what could happen to many other tickers that are pricing in decades of double digits growth when a company magically can't maintain that rate of growth. RIP to all your calls you regards and happy friday. PS Don't forget to go support your GF's favorite DJ this weekend.\n",

Heck it could go to 100-150k for all I care (it won\u2019t) but one thing is for sure: \nCOIN is going down. Why? \n\nTheir customer service is absolute crap. They only just started phone support after many years and none of them can even speak English \nEvery single fast BTC move results in the exchange being shut down. This has been a problem on their exchange for many years with no fix in sight. Not a single other major crypto exchange (Binance/Bitmex/Deribit/etc) has this problem despite having more volume than Coinbase \nThe IV isn\u2019t atrocious like it is on MSTR yet and not many shorts on the stock hence no ensuing squeeze. Most of you regards can actually afford it   \nBrian Armstrong\u2019s wife has been cheating on him\nI have puts\n\nCOIN 150p end of July. The price tanking to below 100 will 50x these.
