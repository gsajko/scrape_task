            "text": "Tons of misinformed regards here about MSTR. See frontpage graphs about \"MSTR Premium way above Bitcoin\" or \"Buy BTC ETF Instead\".\nTo you regards, this is why MSTR premium is way above Corn price, and why MSTR can continue to rise despite Corn prices going up or down.\n1. Analysis of Recent Market Movements on Monday/Friday:\nOn Monday, the price of Bitcoin remained stable around $72,000, while  MSTR experienced a significant increase of 14.35%.\nConversely, on Friday, Bitcoin saw a decrease from $71,000 to $69,000, yet MSTR showed a  notable increase of approximately 6.3%.\nContrary to speculation suggesting MSTR's price surge is solely  attributed to leveraged Bitcoin purchases, this was due to substantial unrealized losses experienced by short sellers since MSTR's  price at $400.\n2. Misguided Assumptions by Short Sellers:\nThe high short interest observed in MSTR at its $400 price stemmed from short seller's erroneous assumption that investors would shift from mining stocks (such as MARA, RIOT, CLSK) and MSTR to ETFs for Bitcoin exposure. However, this assumption proved to be incorrect as the premium for MSTR grew, resulting in substantial paper losses in the billions.\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-sellers-lost-3-3-233548587.html\n3. High Paper Losses from Shorts Since $400\nThese losses, amounting to over $6 billion, have persisted due to a short interest of roughly 23% since MSTR's lower valuation. Despite a current short interest  of approximately 17%, a significant portion of short sellers has yet  to cover their positions, indicating the potential for further price escalation.\nThe increasing pressure from stock repurchases and the impending Bitcoin halving necessitate hedge funds to exit their short positions on MSTR, thereby precipitating a squeeze.\n4. Escalating Pressure on Short Sellers:\nThe convergence of rare events, including the imminent Bitcoin halving and the continuous upward trajectory of Bitcoin's price, has created pressure on short sellers. The prospect of Bitcoin's price sustaining levels above $60,000, coupled with the risk of significant paper losses leading to potential liquidations by lending institutions, has pressured short sellers to exit their MSTR positions. This scenario presents a unique confluence of circumstances, triggering a cascading effect as more funds  cover their short positions.\n____\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:41bbbffaf094b:0-bitcoin-crash-triggered-by-failed-1-billion-hedge-fund-spread-trade-expert/\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mstr/short-interest\nDespite a current short interest of ~17%, a significant portion of short sellers have yet to cover their billions in paper losses. However, a few have covered their positions this week, which is why you've been seeing MSTR go up 14% or 6% despite Bitcoin prices dropping.\nThe main possibility short sellers get to liquidate their positions without a major loss is if Bitcoin prices sharply drop below typical correction levels (eg. $45k). Otherwise, if Bitcoin holds, drops slightly, or increases, we'll likely see MSTR go up in price due to billions in short seller buybacks.\n",

Like, if you buy with unsettled funds in a cash account, you can sell the next day instead of waiting two days to sell. So you can react faster in order to profit more or reduce loss.\nSo then:\n1) The focus has been on rules for retail trades, but there are also changes going into effect for institutional investors. How exactly is institutional trading affected?\n2) What are your predictions - will the new rules make the trading environment more volatile or less? Personally, I kinda see this change as adding volatility by increasing the volume of trades, but overall decreasing volatility, smoothing out jaggedness in price action caused by the T+2 delay.\nRegarding the changes for institutional trading, the SEC says here, https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-29:\n\nIn addition to shortening the standard settlement cycle, the final rules will improve the processing of institutional trades. Specifically, the final rules will require a broker-dealer to either enter into written agreements or establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the completion of allocations, confirmations, and affirmations as soon as technologically practicable and no later than the end of trade date. The final rules also require registered investment advisers to make and keep records of the allocations, confirmations, and affirmations for certain securities transactions. \n\nTL;DR: What will be different in terms of volatility after May 28?\n",

More demand equals more tendies for us.\nTech Boom: With everything going digital, from 5G to IoT to self-driving cars, the demand for chips is through the roof. TSM's got the tech and the chops to meet that demand and then some.\nTop Dog Status: TSM ain't just any semiconductor company; they're the top dog in the manufacturing game. They're pumping out chips using cutting-edge tech like 7nm and 5nm processes. That's like printing money, baby.\nSupply Chain Master: While other companies might be struggling with supply chain issues, TSM's got it locked down tight. Their solid supply chain and diverse customer base mean they're not just surviving the chaos; they're thriving in it.\nBullish Buzz: You know how hype can send a stock to the moon? Well, TSM's been getting some serious buzz lately.
