When it first decided to list, it was aiming for a valuation of more than $15 billion; however, the company has lowered its sights to $5 billion according to the New York Times.\nIs Reddit profitable?\nNo, Reddit isn\u2019t profitable. However, the company has been substantially growing revenue in the past few years. Reddit\u2019s total revenue in 2023 was $804 million, up 21% from $666 million in 2022. Reddit\u2019s net loss for 2023 narrowed to $90.8 million.\nIs Reddit Owned by the CCP?\nNo, but Chinese company TenCent (which like all companies in China, takes orders from the CCP) owns a 7.5% stake in Reddit.\nHow Much Does Reddit\u2019s CEO Make Despite the Business Hemorrhaging hundreds of millions of dollars every year?\nReddit CEO Steve Huffman's total compensation exceeded $193M in 2023.  YIKES.\nWhat Are Some Power Dynamic and Risk Factors That Face Reddit In the Coming Years?\nLast year Reddit mods, who are unpaid wildcards, took many of their subreddits private in protest of API changes that Reddit corporate made.  This massively disrupted the advertisement business that Reddit uses to generate money (despite losing money every single year since inception) and can/will happen again due to Reddits\u2019s reliance on unpaid moderation.\nThere\u2019s an expectation that because of all the gnarly NSFW content, advertisers will shy away from the platform so they don\u2019t have their add pop up in between posts of midget porn and foot jerking.\nIs the FTC investigating them at all?\nYes, they are investigating their potential use of data in large language AI model training.\nIs there an insider lockup period for any of those that got pre-IPO shares?\nYes.\n",

            "text": "Everyone is saying \"I cannot wait to short Reddit\" but if you look at the large picture many things are working in Reddit's favor to have a successful IPO. \n1. Banks and Exchanges want a successful high-profile IPO.\nOnly 151 companies went public last year. This is down significantly from 2021 when there were 1,035. \nPart of the reason for the decline is many high-profile companies that quickly fell below their IPO levels like Instacart. Investment banks make money by partnering with companies in the IPO process; Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, J.P.Morgan and Bank of America Securities are the lead underwriters for Reddit.\n2. Limited institutional interest in shorting the stock\nVery few funds or institutions are going to short the stock. As I mentioned investment banks want more IPOs so why would they short Reddit and potentially cause more companies to stay private? Additionally, after the short-squeeze that happened with Game S no fund is going to risk shorting Reddit. The risk of being burned is too high for the possible reward. Also, because Reddit is so new there are no swaps or other complex instruments available, the only way to short would be actual short-selling. Bill Ackman ran into this same issue with herbalife and got burned.\n3. Options will not be available immediately and the exchange has discretion on when to allow them. \nGoing back to my first point. The NYSE has an interest in the IPO going well. They know options will increase volatility so they will wait as long as possible before allowing options to be traded. Options are the only way 99% of retial investors can go short on a stock. Obviously, you could actually short-sell the stock but the average retail investor will not and it's not even possible on Robinhood. \n\nAs I am writing this it was just announced because of strong demand the IPO will be at the top of the IPO range ($34) . Another reason Reddit will have a strong IPO. I locked in 100 shares for tomorrow via the IPO. See ya'll regards on the moon.\n",

So many boomers buying index funds means that we get to predict what they will need to buy. the lazy bankers over at Goldman, JP Morgan, BOFA, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, DB and the others got this oversubscribed by only selling to the people who were already captive buyers.   The timing on this is not instantaneous, but plays out over the index rebalancing's noted in KEY DATES\n\u200b\n\n\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n\n\nEventually the street will care about RDDT making money, but not today.  The ability to dial up the advertising saturation is the key for longer term investors.\n\n\nCOMPS\n\n\n\nbasically fair priced.  lazy bankers love to price leaving money on the table. Plenty of upside.\n\n\nENGAGEMENT\n\n\n\ngood enough.\n\n\nDEAL STRUCTURE\n\n\n\nnothing to like here, the CEO pay business suck, but is forgivable given the IPO.  but I would blackball them if they tried to pull this shit again.\n\u200b\n\n\nKEY DATES\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tyva1wzbukpc1.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=402ec2d2db5156f37e94c93e4b63054db03a850e\n\n\nRECCOMENDATION\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wlvllm2lukpc1.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=5db615f22cef18051b49d7bec288eaabcaa91727\nRISKS, UNKNOWS AND THE APE FACTOR\nI would really like to know about per user engagement trends.   This will become more important as they further saturate the subredds with ads.\nWSB Apes may jump on the bandwagon and exaggerate and quicken the trend.   WSB appears mostly frosty to the RDDT IPO, but then again \u2026...I don't see any WSB downside. But not seeing any frothy actions like  WSB heydays.  WSB getting boring?  good.  That's why we are so highly regarded.\n\u200b\n",

            "text": "\u200b\nLiterally me right now (if you saw the movie you know)\nSo the sell-off that everyone expected did not happen in Mar 12. I thought the whole point of going public is to sell some stocks of the company to raise capital. It's hard to believe they will hold onto 90% of the stock even after the lock up, unless it has always been to plan to make only 10% of the company public tradable. Even they sell a small percentage of what they are holding, say 10% more, it will cause the available stocks on the market to double.\nI can think of a few reasons why Softbank should sell. But they might be just wishful thinking from my part.\n\nKeep in mind that Softbank does not benefit from the current stock price until they actually sell, because the current free float was sold to the market at IPO price.\nPE too high. 1600 ttm, 100 forward. Are you kidding me? (inb4 \"PE does not matter in AI stocks\")\nThere are better AI stocks out there. Why would someone hold ARM over NVDA?\n\nPosition: Apr 17, $100 puts and $80 puts.\n",
