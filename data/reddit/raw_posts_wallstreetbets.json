            "text": "\nNvidia's Comparison to Cisco in 2000: \n\nNvidia is often compared to Cisco Systems during the dot-com bubble, both being pivotal players in their respective industries. However, Nvidia's advantages, including its invention of the GPU and development of the CUDA platform, make it a stronger entity than Cisco was at the time. Nvidia's rapid growth and expanding margins further differentiate it from Cisco's performance during the dot-com boom.\n\nCompetition in AI Won't Diminish Nvidia's Leadership: \n\nDespite emerging competition in AI GPU technology, Nvidia's comprehensive ecosystem, featuring assets like CUDA and Superchips, sets it apart. While competitors may affect pricing, Nvidia continues to explore new markets, such as AI PC chips and edge computing, maintaining its competitive edge and potential for growth.\n\nNvidia's Valuation Isn't Overstretched: \n\nSome argue that Nvidia's stock is overvalued, akin to a bubble. However, the company's strong fundamentals, including significant profit growth and reasonable valuation metrics, suggest otherwise. With expected growth and competitive advantages, Nvidia's current valuation appears reasonable and less prone to a sudden collapse.\nThis post  is basically a simplified version of an article found on yahoo finance.

AMD analysts model an acceleration to 21.9% growth in 2024 to $30.5 billion.\nAnalyst Opinions\nNvidia's software moat around CUDA is viewed as a key competitive advantage that will make it difficult for rivals to displace Nvidia's leadership position. For AMD, analysts are optimistic about continued share gains in server CPUs against Intel, and expect AMD to emerge as the clear #2 player in data center GPUs behind Nvidia.\nRisks and Uncertainty\nIf enterprise adoption of AI is slower than expected or if hyper scalers shift workloads to in-house chips, it would impact growth estimates for AMD and Nvidia. Geopolitical tensions around AI and potential export restrictions are another risk factor.\nEarnings and Profit Drivers\nAnalysts model Nvidia's GAAP operating margins can reach 64% by fiscal 2027. AMD is also expected to expand margins, with a long-term target of 35% adjusted operating margins.\nRead the full article here:\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-vs-nvidia-a-comparative-analysis-for-2024\n",

I know seasonality to some can be BS but in a bull market, seasonality is a fair metric to CALIBRATE future predictions. \nLast week we got a boost from FOMC, pushing the Qs from ~445 to ~447. Honestly a small move for such a substantial FOMC catalyst. I think there is more in the tank for this week and seasonality suggests so. (Note: this upcoming bullish QQQ week can be credited to MSFT for also having one of its best weeks on the horizon as well) \n----\nHopefully Monday is flat/closes red with Consumer Confidence uncertainty looming (data is released on Tues), no matter the result of CC I think we rally hard tues into the remainder of the week to stay on par with QQQ's bullish seasonality. \n\nTake weekly QQQ 445 strike calls + QQQ weekly 447 calls \nOptional: MSFT 415 strike, May 17 calls (I already own one but plan on adding another if Monday is red) \n\nLMK your thoughts, seasonality has been one of the best metrics for me so far (Cashed on ANET last week which has 70% + in March) Lets ride fellas! \n\u200b\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cs8jzmve4bqc1.png?width=2892&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffe91fecb43f18395c79be20e207a1c5b5150511\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0hc643c4bqc1.png?width=2894&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7aef8f78dafbce6392a8283db7b5432e0c1cc24\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cv4csgancqc1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=006fac606b35edd16168e3e140ad1888864bcc6d\n",

Previously it was 'wait 5 seconds, then can skip both ads', now it's 'wait 5 seconds, skip the first ad, wait another 5 seconds, skip the second ad'.\nThis just blew my mind (not literally thankfully).\nJust think about it my friends. This small change has effectively increased YouTube's mobile ad revenue by 100%. 100% (in theory). Incredible. Mobile ad revenue is a big chunk of Alphabet's revenue, so IMO revenue might beat expectations.\nAlso they might announce more details about integrating AI into apple products, so another bullish reason for next earnings.\nObviously have to throw some meat to those hungry bears, so another thought is that this increase in mobile ad revenue is offset by a potential increase in ad blockers from YouTube's more aggressive ad policy. IDK, just speculation as it can't be measured externally.\nLet me know your thoughts\n:)\n",

I buy up some because I like nuclear. Panicked at what looked like a 2 week pump and dump and sold. Looks like that was the case.\nWhat happened here?? Was this a pump and dump to get the price up to pre-crash prices so that stockholders could recoup their cash and tone down the lawsuit stuff? How does this even happen?\n",
